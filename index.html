            <h2>Hello There!</h2>
            <p>I'm Orion Palmer. Currently I am a music educator at Chukker Creek Elementary. As a music teacher I
                service the school's entire student body and have developed multiple curriculums and programs to elevate and display the
                skills of my students within a variety of mediums. My commitment to my students and community has led to me earning the title of
                Teacher of the Year at my school.</p>
            <p>At this time however, I'm looking into other mediums to generate a greater impact in educational services that will not only help teachers but also students in finding enjoyment in learning. If I am able to, I would love to be responsible in helping create programs
                that can assist learners in becoming more adept with musical processes.</p>

                <h3>Technology Career</h3>
                <p class="code-skill-description">I have taken a great interest in programming over this past couple of months,
                    using my weekends and
                    spare
                    moments
                    on the weekdays when I am not grading assignments and leading projects to study coding from a variety professionals in the
                    field and Google.
                    At
                    this time I have a foundation in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery which is only strengthen as I begin building my own original projects.. In addition to this, I am becoming familiar with the
                    process
                    of documentation and learning how to independently search and create solutions to problems I encounter
                    as I
                    learn to program. At this stage of my journey I am begining to develop my own personal landing pages using the tools I've gathered from instructor presented projects and the vast resources of Google. I do not intend to slow down, I intend to learn, I intend to be worthy, I
                    intend to
                    demonstrate my grit and my capability to adapt to change and fulfill a new calling.</p>

                <h3>Education Career</h3>
                <p class="education-description">Teaching has been a profession that I have dedicated the past decade of
                    my life to as
                    demonstrated by
                    earning
                    a Bachelors and Master degree in Music Education and becoming a Teacher of the Year recipient. I
                    am
                    highly
                    skill in a variety of instructional practices and mediums as my work prior and during the
                    pandemic has
                    taught me to be flexible and adapt to the circumstances in order to meet data-driven goals and
                    provide
