            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p>I'm Orion Palmer. Currently I am a music educator at Chukker Creek Elementary. As a music teacher I
                service the entire school and have developed multiple curriculums and programs to elevate and show the
                skills of my students in a variety of mediums. This along with many of my involvement with the community
                over the course of this past year and a half in this position have led to me earning the title of
                Teacher of the Year at my school.</p>
            <p>At this time however, I'm looking to find other ways to provide educational opportunities to adult
                learners in different field. If I am able to, I would love to be responsible in helping create programs
                that can assist learners in becoming more adept with musical processes.</p>

            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <div class="skill-row">
                <h3><em>Technology Career</em></h3>
                <p>I have taken a great interest in programming over this past month, using my weekend mornings and
                    spare
                    hours
                    on the weekdays from grading assignments to study coding and learn more from professionals in the
                    field.
                    At
                    this time I am adept in both HTML and CSS. In addition to this I becoming highly familiar with the
                    process
                    documentation and learning how to independently search and create solutions of problems I encounter
                    while I
                    am coding. My next step is to learn JavaScript so that I can begin building 6 landing pages by the
                    end
                    of my
                    third month of learning. I do not intend to slow down, I intend to learn, I intend to be worthy, I
                    intend to
                    demonstrate my grit and my capability to adapt and change and fulfill a new calling.</p>
                <h3><em>Education Career</em></h3>
                <p>Teaching has been a profession that I have dedicated the past decade of my life to as
                    demonstrated by
                    earning
                    a Bachelors and Master degree in Music Education and becoming a Teacher of the Year recipient. I
                    am
                    highly
                    skill in a variety of instructional practices and mediums as my work prior and during the
                    pandemic has
                    taught me to be flexible and adapt to the circumstances in order to meet data-driven goals and
                    provide
                    high-quality services to stakeholders.</p>
